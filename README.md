## 1. Required Azure Services to Compare

At a minimum, your report must include the following Azure services:

- **Azure Functions** (Triggers & Bindings)
- **Durable Functions** (Chaining, Orchestration, Fan-out/Fan-in)
- **Azure Logic Apps**
- **Azure Service Bus** (Queues & Topics)
- **Azure Event Grid**
- **Azure Event Hubs**

_(You may include additional Azure services from the course if relevant.)_

## 2. Identifying the closest AWS/GCP Equivalents

| Azure                                                       | AWS                                                                | GCP                                                                                   |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Azure Functions (Triggers & Bindings)                       | AWS lambda                                                         | Cloud Run Functions                                                                   |
| Durable Functions (Chaining, Orchestration, Fan-out/Fan-in) | AWS Step Functions                                                 | Google Cloud Workflows                                                                |
| Azure Logic Apps                                            | AWS Step Functions (closest for workflow automation/orchestration) | Application Integration (closest low-code integration service)                        |
| Azure Service Bus (Queues & Topics)                         | Amazon SQS + Amazon SNS                                            | Pub/Sub                                                                               |
| Azure Event Grid                                            | Amazon EventBridge                                                 | Eventarc                                                                              |
| Azure Event Hubs                                            | Amazon Kinesis Data Streams                                        | Pub/Sub (or Pub/Sub Lite if you want to emphasize partitioned, high-volume streaming) |

## 3. Comparing the Services

For each service, include:

- **Overview** – brief description of each service
- **Core Features** – supported triggers, bindings, messaging/eventing capabilities
- **Integration Options** – how it works with other cloud services or CI/CD pipelines
- **Monitoring & Observability** – available tools/logging integrations
- **Pricing Model** – high-level cost considerations
- **Strengths & Weaknesses** – from a serverless architecture perspective

---

## 4. Organize in Markdown

- Create a `README.md` file in your GitHub repository containing your report
- Use **headings**, **tables**, and **bullet points** for clarity
- Include a **comparison table** for each service, followed by a **narrative analysis**
